# Hi, I'm Andria üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm a web developer with a passion :fire: for front-end development.
I enjoy working on open source projects :octocat:; I'm currently maintaining React Spring Modal and contributing to Use Shopping Cart and Rebuild Black Business when I can. I also like exploring automation :robot: and tooling :wrench:. Most of the time, I like to relax by playing some casual video games and watching shows like Grey's Anatomy. My pronouns are she/her.
